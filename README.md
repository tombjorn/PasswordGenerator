New to programming, taking stuff I learn from 'cs50', 'codingtrain', 'portfolio courses' and more; trying to branch out and do a bit of independant learning. Quickly bumped into the headfuck of C arrays/strings/functions relationships/behaviours, or lack of. JS felt nicer to me than C but liking how brutally pedantic it feels, feels like a good thing to learn the basics on.

please feel free to lend me a tip or two.
